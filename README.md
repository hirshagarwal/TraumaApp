# TraumaApp
Comprehensive Emergency Information System
###Abstract###
An app designed to help Emergency Medical Services and Hospitals organize information during emergencies.

### Overview ###
An app that will semi-autonomously generate patient reports that are upladed and synced with a hospital database. This system can provide a more comprehensive overview of an emergency situation. Data regarding the status of specific patients as well as a situation in general can be entered through the mobile app by responders in the field. This data can be viewed by hospital staff at trauma centers such that they can prepare for the incoming patients more effectively.

###Technical Goals###
* Design a mobile app which is efficient and intuitive for entering patient and situation information.
* Build an analysis platform which can access a database and allow hospitals to analyse data.
